            <b>Example 3 (Addressing Rumors)</b>
            <p>Their internal inquiries are met with denials from PPP management, but the rumors persist. Feeling left
                in the dark, Andy contemplates leading an employee buyout of PPP's equity management business.

        <dd>
            <p>
                <i>Comment</i> : An employee-led buyout of business is consistent with Standard IV(A) because it would
                rest on the permission of the employer and the clients. In this case, employees suspect the senior
                managers, Andy should consult legal counsel.
