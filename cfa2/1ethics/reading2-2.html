            <b>Example 2 (Controlling Nonpublic Information)</b>
            <p>Andy is advised that the company's earnings projections for the next year have significantly dropped in
                a call. Throughout the telephone conference call, several salespeople walk in and out of Andy's
                office. Before the conference call is concluded, the salespeople trade the stock of the company on
                behalf of the firm's clients.

                <i>Comment</i> : Andy failed to protect material nonpublic information to others in his firm.
                firm should have adopted information barriers. The salespeople trade on inside information.

        </dd>

        <dt>
            <b>Example 3 (Selective Disclosure of Material Information)</b>
            <p>During a meeting with Andy, the finance director states that the company expects its workforce to strike
                next Friday, which will cripple productivity and distribution.
            </p>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p><i>Comment</i> : Andy must first determine whether the material information is public.</p>

            <b>Example 4 (Determining Materiality)</b>
            <p><u style="color:rgb(255,0,0)"><b>Andy's doctor</b></u> mentions that she thinks that the company will
                soon be bought out by a large multinational conglomerate. After talAndy to various investment
                professionals and checAndy their opinions on the company as well as checAndy industry trends, Andy
                decides the next day to accumulate more stock.

            <b>Example 5 (Applying the Mosaic Theory)</b>
            <p>Andy discovers that SSS, may be in financial trouble, also talks to some designers and retailers. SSS's
                extravagant new designs have been introduced at substantial cost. The public is now buying more
                conservative furniture from other makers. Based on this information and on a profit-and-loss analysis,
                Andy believes that SSS's next quarter earnings will drop substantially. He issues a sell recommendation
                for SSS. Immediately after receiving that recommendation, investment managers start reducing the SSS
                stock in their portfolios.

                <i>Comment</i> : Designers and retailers' opinions are nonmaterial nonpublic information. All source

            <b>Example</b>
            <p>After speaAndy with representatives of TTT, a European auto manufacturer with sales primarily in South
                Korea, and after conducting interviews with
                <u style="color:rgb(255,0,0)"><b>salespeople, labor leaders, his firm's Korean currency analysts, and
                        banAndy officials</b></u>, Andy analyzed TTT and concluded that (1) its newly introduced model
                will probably not meet sales expectations, (2) its corporate restructuring strategy may well face
                serious opposition from unions, (3) the depreciation of the Korean won should lead to pressure on
                margins for the industry in general and TTT's market segment in particular, and (4) banks could take a
                tougher-than-expected stance in the upcoming round of credit renegotiations with the company. For these
                reasons, he changes his recommendation.

                strong earnings when the firm publicly announces in two days.

        <dd>
            <p>
                <i>Comment</i> : Unless the source had an ongoing business relationship with the firm, there is no
