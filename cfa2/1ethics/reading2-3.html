                <i>Comment</i> : Andy should check with his firm's compliance department or appropriate legal counsel
                to determine whether applicable regulations require reporting the CFO's financial records.

            <b>Example 5 (Accidental Disclosure of Confidential Information)</b>
            <p>One of Andy's clients responded directly on the group page that his family recently experienced a major
                change, with highly personal and confidential details of the event. Unfortunately, all clients were
                also able to read the detailed posting until Andy was able to have the comment removed.

                <i>Comment</i> : The accidental disclosure of confidential information by a client is not under Andy's
                control. His actions to remove the information promptly align with Standard III(E).
