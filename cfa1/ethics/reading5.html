	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<ul>
		<br />
		<li>The goals
			<ul>
				<br />
				<li>To establish investment industry best practices for
					calculating and presenting investment performance that promote
					investor interests and instill investor confidence;</li>
				<br />
				<li>To obtain worldwide acceptance of a single standard for the
					calculation and presentation of investment performance based on the
					principles of fair representation and full disclosure;</li>
				<br />
				<li>To promote the use of accurate and consistent investment
					performance data;</li>
				<br />
				<li>To encourage fair, global competition among investment
					firms without creating barriers to entry;</li>
				<br />
				<li>To foster the notion of industry “self-regulation” on a
					global basis.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>Key features
			<ul>
				<br />
				<li>The GIPS standards are ethical standards for investment
					performance presentation to ensure fair representation and full
					disclosure of investment performance. In order to claim compliance,
					firms must adhere to the requirements included in the GIPS
					standards.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Meeting the objectives of fair representation and full
					disclosure is likely to require more than simply adhering to the
					minimum requirements of the GIPS standards. Firms should also
					adhere to the recommendations to achieve best practice in the
					calculation and presentation of performance.</li>
				<br />
				<li>The GIPS standards require firms to include all actual,
					discretionary, fee-paying portfolios in at least one composite
					defined by investment mandate, objective, or strategy in order to
					prevent firms from cherry-picking their best performance.</li>
				<br />
				<li>The GIPS standards rely on the integrity of input data. The
					accuracy of input data is critical to the accuracy of the
					performance presentation. The underlying valuations of portfolio
					holdings drive the portfolio’s performance. It is essential for
					these and other inputs to be accurate. The GIPS standards require
					firms to adhere to certain calculation methodologies and to make
					specific disclosures along with the firm’s performance.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Firms must comply with all requirements of the GIPS
					standards, including any updates, Guidance Statements,
					interpretations, Questions & Answers (Q&As), and clarifications
					published by CFA Institute and the GIPS Executive Committee, which
					are available on the GIPS website (www.gipsstandards.org) as well
					as in the GIPS Handbook.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>Historical Performance Record
			<ul>
				<br />
				<li>A firm is required to initially present, at a minimum, five
					years of annual investment performance that is compliant with the
					GIPS standards. If the firm or the composite has been in existence
					less than five years, the firm must present performance since the
					firm’s inception or the composite inception date.</li>
				<br />
				<li>After a firm presents a minimum of five years of
					GIPS-compliant performance (or for the period since the firm’s
					inception or the composite inception date if the firm or the
					composite has been in existence less than five years), the firm
					must present an additional year of performance each year, building
					up to a minimum of 10 years of GIPS-compliant performance.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Firms may link non-GIPS-compliant performance to their
					GIPS-compliant performance provided that only GIPS-compliant
					performance is presented for periods after 1 January 2000 and the
					firm discloses the periods of non-compliance. Firms must not link
					non-GIPS-compliant performance for periods beginning on or after 1
					January 2000 to their GIPS-compliant performance. Firms that manage
					private equity, real estate, and/or wrap fee/separately managed
					account (SMA) portfolios must also comply with Sections 6, 7, and
					8, respectively, of the Provisions of the GIPS standards that
					became effective as of 1 January 2006.</li>

							<ul>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.1 FIRMs must comply with all the requirements of
									the GIPS standards, including any updates, Guidance Statements,
									interpretations, Questions & Answers (Q&As), and clarifications
									published by CFA Institute and the GIPS Executive Committee,
									which are available on the GIPS standards website
									(www.gipsstandards.org) as well as in the GIPS Handbook.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.2 FIRMs must comply with all applicable laws and
									regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of
									performance.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.3 FIRMs must not present performance or
									performance-related information that is false or misleading.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.4 The GIPS standards must be applied on a FIRM-wide
									basis.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.5 FIRMs must document their policies and procedures
									used in establishing and maintaining compliance with the GIPS
									standards, including ensuring the existence and ownership of
									client assets, and must apply them consistently.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.6 If the FIRM does not meet all the requirements of
									the GIPS standards, the FIRM must not represent or state that
									it is “in compliance with the Global Investment Performance
									Standards except for . . .” or make any other statements that
									may indicate partial compliance with the GIPS standards.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.7 Statements referring to the calculation
									methodology as being “in accordance,” “in compliance,” or
									“consistent” with the Global Investment Performance Standards,
									or similar statements, are prohibited.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.8 Statements referring to the performance of a
									single, existing client portfolio as being “calculated in
									accordance with the Global Investment Performance Standards”
									are prohibited, except when a GIPS-compliant FIRM reports the
									performance of an individual client’s portfolio to that client.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.9 FIRMs must make every reasonable effort to
									provide a compliant presentation to all prospective clients.
									FIRMs must not choose to whom they present a compliant
									presentation. As long as a prospective client has received a
									compliant presentation within the previous 12 months, the FIRM
									has met this requirement.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.10 FIRMs must provide a complete list of composite
									descriptions to any prospective client that makes such a
									request. FIRMs must include terminated composites on the FIRM’s
									list of composite descriptions for at least five years after
									the composite termination date.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.11 FIRMs must provide a compliant presentation for
									any composite listed on the FIRM’s list of composite
									descriptions to any prospective client that makes such a
									request.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.12 FIRMs must be defined as an investment FIRM,
									subsidiary, or division held out to clients or prospective
									clients as a distinct business entity.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.13 For periods beginning on or after 1 January
									2011, total FIRM assets must be the aggregate fair value of all
									discretionary and non-discretionary assets managed by the FIRM.
									This includes both fee-paying and non-fee-paying portfolios.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.14 Total FIRM assets must include assets assigned
									to a sub-advisor provided the FIRM has discretion over the
									selection of the sub-advisor.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.15 Changes in a FIRM’s organization must not lead
									to alteration of historical composite performance.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.A.16 When the FIRM jointly markets with other FIRMs,
									the FIRM claiming compliance with the GIPS standards must be
									sure that it is clearly defined and separate relative to other
									FIRMs being marketed, and that it is clear which FIRM is
									claiming compliance.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>Fundamentals of Compliance—Recommendations
							<ul>
								<br />
								<li>0.B.1 FIRMs should comply with the recommendations of
									the GIPS standards, including recommendations in any updates,
									Guidance Statements, interpretations, Questions & Answers
									(Q&As), and clarifications published by CFA Institute and the
									GIPS Executive Committee, which will be made available on the
									GIPS website (www.gipsstandards.org) as well as in the GIPS
									Handbook.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.B.2 FIRMs should be verified.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.B.3 FIRMs should adopt the broadest, most meaningful
									definition of the FIRM. The scope of this definition should
									include all geographical (country, regional, etc.) offices
									operating under the same brand name regardless of the actual
									name of the individual investment management company.</li>
								<br />
								<li>0.B.4 FIRMs should provide to each existing client, on
									an annual basis, a compliant presentation of the composite in
									which the client’s portfolio is included.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>1. Input Data
					<ul>
						<br />
						<li>Input Data—Requirements
							<ul>
								<br />
								<li>1.A.1 All data and information necessary to support all
									items included in a compliant presentation must be captured and
									maintained.</li>
								<br />
								<li>1.A.2 For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011,
									portfolios must be valued in accordance with the definition of
									fair value and the GIPS Valuation Principles.</li>
								<br />
								<li>1.A.3 Firms must value portfolios in accordance with
									the composite-specific valuation policy. Portfolios must be
									valued:
									<ol type="a">
										<br />
										<li>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2001, at
											least monthly.</li>
										<br />
										<li>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010, on
											the date of all large cash flows. Firms must define large
											cash flow for each composite to determine when portfolios in
											that composite must be valued.</li>
										<br />
										<li>No more frequently than required by the valuation
											policy.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<br />
								<li>1.A.4 For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010,
									firms must value portfolios as of the calendar month end or the
									last business day of the month.</li>
								<br />
								<li>1.A.5 For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005,
									firms must use trade date accounting.</li>
								<br />
								<li>1.A.6 Accrual accounting must be used for fixed-income
									securities and all other investments that earn interest income.
									The value of fixed-income securities must include accrued
									income.</li>
								<br />
								<li>1.A.7 For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006,
									composites must have consistent beginning and ending annual
									valuation dates. Unless the composite is reported on a
									non-calendar fiscal year, the beginning and ending valuation
									dates must be at calendar year end or on the last business day
									of the year.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>Input Data—Recommendations
							<ul>
								<br />
								<li>1.B.1 Firms should value portfolios on the date of all
									external cash flows.</li>
								<br />
								<li>1.B.2 Valuations should be obtained from a qualified
									independent third party.</li>
								<br />
								<li>1.B.3 Accrual accounting should be used for dividends
									(as of the ex-dividend date).</li>
								<br />
								<li>1.B.4 Firms should accrue investment management fees.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>2. Calculation Methodology
					<ul>
						<br />
						<li>Calculation Methodology—Requirements
							<ul>
								<br />
								<li>2.A.1 Total returns must be used.</li>
								<br />
								<li>2.A.2 Firms must calculate time-weighted rates of
									return that adjust for external cash flows. Both periodic and
									sub-period returns must be geometrically linked. External cash
									flows must be treated according to the firm’s
									composite-specific policy. At a minimum:
									<ol type="a">
										<br />
										<li>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2001,
											firms must calculate portfolio returns at least monthly.</li>
										<br />
										<li>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005,
											firms must calculate portfolio returns that adjust for
											daily-weighted external cash flows.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<br />
								<li>2.A.3 Returns from cash and cash equivalents held in
									portfolios must be included in all return calculations.</li>
								<br />
								<li>2.A.4 All returns must be calculated after the
									deduction of the actual trading expenses incurred during the
									period. Firms must not use estimated trading expenses.</li>
								<br />
								<li>2.A.5 If the actual trading expenses cannot be
									identified and segregated from a bundled fee:
									<ol type="a">
										<br />
										<li>When calculating gross-of-fees returns, returns must
											be reduced by the entire bundled fee or the portion of the
											bundled fee that includes the trading expenses. Firms must
											not use estimated trading expenses.</li>
										<br />
										<li>When calculating net-of-fees returns, returns must be
											reduced by the entire bundled fee or the portion of the
											bundled fee that includes the trading expenses and the
											investment management fee. Firms must not use estimated
											trading expenses.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<br />
								<li>2.A.6 Composite returns must be calculated by
									asset-weighting the individual portfolio returns using
									beginning-of-period values or a method that reflects both
									beginning-of-period values and external cash flows.</li>
								<br />
								<li>2.A.7 Composite returns must be calculated:
									<ol type="a">
										<br />
										<li>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006, by
											asset-weighting the individual portfolio returns at least
											quarterly.</li>
										<br />
										<li>For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010, by
											asset-weighting the individual portfolio returns at least
											monthly.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>Calculation Methodology—Recommendations
							<ul>
								<br />
								<li>2.B.1 Returns should be calculated net of
									non-reclaimable withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and
									capital gains. Reclaimable withholding taxes should be accrued.</li>
								<br />
								<li>2.B.2 For periods prior to 1 January 2010, firms should
									calculate composite returns by asset-weighting the individual
									portfolio returns at least monthly.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>3. Composite Construction
					<ul>
						<br />
						<li>Composite Construction—Requirements
							<ul>
								<br />
								<li>3.A.1 All actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios
									must be included in at least one composite. Although
									non-fee-paying discretionary portfolios may be included in a
									composite (with appropriate disclosure), non-discretionary
									portfolios must not be included in a firm’s composites.</li>
								<br />
								<li>3.A.2 Composites must include only actual assets
									managed by the firm.</li>
								<br />
								<li>3.A.3 Firms must not link performance of simulated or
									model portfolios with actual performance.</li>
								<br />
								<li>3.A.4 Composites must be defined according to
									investment mandate, objective, or strategy. Composites must
									include all portfolios that meet the composite definition. Any
									change to a composite definition must not be applied
									retroactively. The composite definition must be made available
									upon request.</li>
								<br />
								<li>3.A.5 Composites must include new portfolios on a
									timely and consistent basis after each portfolio comes under
									management.</li>
								<br />
								<li>3.A.6 Terminated portfolios must be included in the
									historical performance of the composite up to the last full
									measurement period that each portfolio was under management.</li>
								<br />
								<li>3.A.7 Portfolios must not be switched from one
									composite to another unless documented changes to a portfolio’s
									investment mandate, objective, or strategy or the redefinition
									of the composite makes it appropriate. The historical
									performance of the portfolio must remain with the original
									composite.</li>
								<br />
								<li>3.A.8 For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010,
									a carve-out must not be included in a composite unless the
									carve-out is managed separately with its own cash balance.</li>
								<br />
								<li>3.A.9 If the firm sets a minimum asset level for
									portfolios to be included in a composite, the firm must not
									include portfolios below the minimum asset level in that
									composite. Any changes to a composite-specific minimum asset
									level must not be applied retroactively.</li>
								<br />
								<li>3.A.10 Firms that wish to remove portfolios from
									composites in cases of significant cash flows must define
									“significant” on an ex-ante, composite-specific basis and must
									consistently follow the composite-specific policy.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>Composite Construction—Recommendations
							<ul>
								<br />
								<li>3.B.1 If the firm sets a minimum asset level for
									portfolios to be included in a composite, the firm should not
									present a compliant presentation of the composite to a
									prospective client known not to meet the composite’s minimum
									asset level.</li>
								<br />
								<li>3.B.2 To remove the effect of a significant cash flow,
									the firm should use a temporary new account.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>4. Disclosure
					<ul>
						<br />
						<li>Disclosure—Requirements
							<ul>
								<br />
								<li>4.A.1 Once a firm has met all the requirements of the
									GIPS standards, the firm must disclose its compliance with the
									GIPS standards using one of the following compliance
									statements. The claim of compliance must only be used in a
									compliant presentation. For firms that are verified:
									<blockquote>[Insert name of firm] claims
										compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards
										(GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in
										compliance with the GIPS standards. [Insert name of firm] has
										been independently verified for the periods [insert dates].
										The verification report(s) is/are available upon request.
										Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with
										all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS
										standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm’s policies and
										procedures are designed to calculate and present performance
										in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not
										ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.</blockquote>For
									composites of a verified firm that have also had a performance
									examination:
									<blockquote>[Insert name of firm] claims
										compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards
										(GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in
										compliance with the GIPS standards. [Insert name of firm] has
										been independently verified for the periods [insert dates].
										Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with
										all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS
										standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm’s policies and
										procedures are designed to calculate and present performance
										in compliance with the GIPS standards. The [insert name of
										composite] composite has been examined for the periods [insert
										dates]. The verification and performance examination reports
										are available upon request.</blockquote> For firms that have not been
									verified:
									<blockquote>[Insert name of firm] claims
										compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards
										(GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in
										compliance with the GIPS standards. [Insert name of firm] has
										not been independently verified.</blockquote>

						prospective wrap fee/SMA sponsors, prospective wrap fee/SMA
						clients, and existing wrap fee/SMA sponsors). Unless otherwise
						noted, the following wrap fee/SMA provisions supplement all the
						required and recommended provisions of the GIPS standards in
						Sections 0–5.</p>
					<p>Although there are different types of wrap fee/SMA
						structures, these provisions apply to all wrap fee/SMA portfolios
						where there are bundled fees and the wrap fee/SMA sponsor serves
						as an intermediary between the firm and the end user of the
						investment services. These provisions are not applicable to
						portfolios defined as other types of bundled fee portfolios. These
						provisions are also not applicable to model portfolios that are
						provided by a firm to a wrap fee/SMA sponsor if the firm does not
						have discretionary portfolio management responsibility for the
						individual wrap fee/SMA portfolios. Similarly, a firm or overlay
						manager in a Multiple Strategy Portfolio (MSP) or similar program
						is also excluded from applying these provisions to such portfolios
						if they do not have discretion.</p>

								<b>Composite Construction—Requirements</b>
								<br />
								<li>8.A.1 Firms must include the performance record of
									actual wrap fee/SMA portfolios in appropriate composites in
									accordance with the firm’s established portfolio inclusion
									policies. Once established, these composites (containing actual
									wrap fee/SMA portfolios) must be used in the firm’s compliant
									presentations presented to wrap fee/SMA prospective clients.</li>
								<br />
								<b>Disclosure—Requirements (the following provision does not
									apply: 4.A.15)</b>
								<br />
								<li>8.A.2 For all wrap fee/SMA compliant presentations that
									include periods prior to the inclusion of an actual wrap
									fee/SMA portfolio in the composite, the firm must disclose, for
									each period presented, that the composite does not contain
									actual wrap fee/SMA portfolios.</li>
								<br />
								<li>8.A.3 For any performance presented for periods prior
									to 1 January 2006 that does not comply with the GIPS standards,
									firms must disclose the periods of non-compliance.</li>
								<br />
								<li>8.A.4 When firms present composite performance to an
									existing wrap fee/SMA sponsor that includes only that sponsor’s
									wrap fee/SMA portfolios (resulting in a “sponsor-specific
									composite”):
									<ol type="a">
										<br />
										<li>Firms must disclose the name of the wrap fee/SMA
											sponsor represented by the sponsor-specific composite;</li>
										<br />
										<li>If the sponsor-specific composite compliant
											presentation is intended for the purpose of generating wrap
											fee/SMA business and does not include performance net of the
											entire wrap fee, the compliant presentation must disclose
											that the named sponsor-specific compliant presentation is
											only for the use of the named wrap fee/SMA sponsor.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<br />
								<b>Presentation and Reporting—Requirements (the following
									provision does not apply: 5.A.3)</b>
								<br />
								<li>8.A.5 When firms present performance to a wrap fee/SMA
									prospective client, the composite presented must include the
									performance of all actual wrap fee/SMA portfolios, if any,
									managed according to the composite investment mandate,
									objective, or strategy, regardless of the wrap fee/SMA sponsor
									(resulting in a “style-defined composite”).</li>
								<br />
								<li>8.A.6 When firms present performance to a wrap fee/SMA
									prospective client, performance must be presented net of the
									entire wrap fee.</li>
								<br />
								<li>8.A.7 Firms must not link non-GIPS-compliant
									performance for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006 to
									their GIPS-compliant performance. firms may link
									non-GIPS-compliant performance to their GIPS-compliant
									performance provided that only GIPS-compliant performance is
									presented for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.</li>

		<li>组合群 vs 资产组合
			<ul>
				<br />
				<li>资产组合是基于现代投资组合理论建立的各种资产的集合，主要考虑风险与回报的关系</li>
				<br />
				<li>组合群除了考虑风险与回报的关系，还考虑既定策略或目标的实现</li>
				<br />
				<li>投资组合从投资者角度出发，与个人的风险偏好有很大关系</li>
				<br />
				<li>组合群是投资公司的选择，体现投资公司的某个特定投资策略或投资目标</li>
				<br />
				<li>一个投资公司不会只有一个投资组合，但可以只有一个组合群</li>
				<br />
				<li>组合群收益率用组合群中所有投资组合的资产加权收益率（asset weighted rate of return）表示</li>
				<br />
				<li>相同投资目标或投资策略的投资组合必须纳入一个组合群中，避免投资公司只选择表现好的投资组合</li>
				<br />
				<li>组合群与综合指数（composite index）的表现相似，组合群的市场价值经常变动，且不易计算</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>公司构建组合群时必须满足
			<ul>
				<br />
				<li>所有付费的全权委托的资产组合必须至少包含在一个组合群中</li>
				<br />
				<li>资产组合群必须按照相似的投资目标或投资策略进行定义和界定</li>
				<br />
				<li>公司在管理新的投资组合时，组合群必须及时更新</li>
				<br />
				<li>已终止的投资组合必须包含在适当的组合群的历史业绩记录中</li>
				<br />
				<li>除非有客户的书面变更指示或对组合群重新界定，否则投资组合不得在组合群中转换</li>
				<br />
				<li>可转债和其他混合型债券的处理在不同时期必须保持一致</li>
				<br />
				<li>不包括现金的分离资产（carve-out segments，客户自行管理），不是全权委托的投资组合</li>
				<br />
				<li>组合群只能包括公司实际管理的资产，不包括模拟的投资组合</li>
