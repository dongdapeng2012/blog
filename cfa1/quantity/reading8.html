	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<ul>
		<br />
		<li>A population is defined as all members of a specified group.
			A sample is a subset of a population.</li>
		<br />
		<li>A parameter is any descriptive measure of a population. A
			sample statistic (statistic, for short) is a quantity computed from
			or used to describe a sample.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Data measurements are taken using one of four major scales:
			nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. Nominal scales categorize data
			but do not rank them. Ordinal scales sort data into categories that
			are ordered with respect to some characteristic. Interval scales
			provide not only ranking but also assurance that the differences
			between scale values are equal. Ratio scales have all the
			characteristics of interval scales as well as a true zero point as
			the origin. The scale on which data are measured determines the type
			of analysis that can be performed on the data.</li>
		<br />
		<li>A frequency distribution is a tabular display of data
			summarized into a relatively small number of intervals. Frequency
			distributions permit us to evaluate how data are distributed.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The relative frequency of observations in an interval is the
			number of observations in the interval divided by the total number of
			observations. The cumulative relative frequency cumulates (adds up)
			the relative frequencies as we move from the first interval to the
			last, thus giving the fraction of the observations that are less than
			the upper limit of each interval.</li>
		<br />
		<li>A histogram is a bar chart of data that have been grouped
			into a frequency distribution. A frequency polygon is a graph of
			frequency distributions obtained by drawing straight lines joining
			successive points representing the class frequencies.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Sample statistics such as measures of central tendency,
			measures of dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis help with investment
			analysis, particularly in making probabilistic statements about
			returns.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Measures of central tendency specify where data are centered
			and include the (arithmetic) mean, median, and mode (most frequently
			occurring value). The mean is the sum of the observations divided by
			the number of observations. The median is the value of the middle
			item (or the mean of the values of the two middle items) when the
			items in a set are sorted into ascending or descending order. The
			mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency. The
			median is not influenced by extreme values and is most useful in the
			case of skewed distributions. The mode is the only measure of central
			tendency that can be used with nominal data.</li>
		<br />
		<li>A portfolio’s return is a weighted mean return computed from
			the returns on the individual assets, where the weight applied to
			each asset’s return is the fraction of the portfolio invested in that
			asset.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The geometric mean. The geometric mean is especially
			important in reporting compound growth rates for time series data.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Quantiles such as the median, quartiles, quintiles, deciles,
			and percentiles are location parameters that divide a distribution
			into halves, quarters, fifths, tenths, and hundredths, respectively.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Dispersion measures such as the variance, standard deviation,
			and mean absolute deviation (MAD) describe the variability of
			outcomes around the arithmetic mean.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Range is defined as the maximum value minus the minimum
			value. Range has only a limited scope because it uses information
			from only two observations.</li>
		<br />
		<li>MAD for a sample is ∑(|X-<SPAN
			style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">X</SPAN>|)/n.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>The variance is the average of the squared deviations around
			the mean, and the standard deviation is the positive square root of
			variance. In computing sample variance (s<sup>2</sup>) and sample
			standard deviation, the average squared deviation is computed using a
			divisor equal to the sample size minus 1.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>The semivariance is the average squared deviation below the
			mean; semideviation is the positive square root of semivariance.
			Target semivariance is the average squared deviation below a target
			level; target semideviation is its positive square root. All these
			measures quantify downside risk.</li>
		<br />
		<li>According to Chebyshev’s inequality, the proportion of the
			observations within k standard deviations of the arithmetic mean is
			at least 1 − 1/k<sup>2</sup> for all k > 1. Chebyshev’s inequality
			permits us to make probabilistic statements about the proportion of
			observations within various intervals around the mean for any
			distribution with finite variance. As a result of Chebyshev’s
			inequality, a two-standard-deviation interval around the mean must
			contain at least 75 percent of the observations, and a
			three-standard-deviation interval around the mean must contain at
			least 89 percent of the observations, no matter how the data are
			distributed.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>The coefficient of variation, CV, is the ratio of the
			standard deviation of a set of observations to their mean value. A
			scale-free measure of relative dispersion, by expressing the
			magnitude of variation among observations relative to their average
			size, the CV permits direct comparisons of dispersion across
			different data sets.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The Sharpe ratio for a portfolio, p, based on historical
			returns, is defined as S<sub>h</sub> = (<SPAN
			style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">R<sub>p</sub></SPAN> − <SPAN
			style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">R<sub>F</sub></SPAN>) / <SPAN
			style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">s<sub>p</sub></SPAN> , where <SPAN
			style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">R<sub>p</sub></SPAN> is the mean
			return to the portfolio, <SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">R<sub>F</sub></SPAN>
			is the mean return to a risk-free and asset, and <SPAN
			style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">s<sub>p</sub></SPAN> is the
			standard deviation of return on the portfolio.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>Skew describes the degree to which a distribution is not
			symmetric about its mean. A return distribution with positive
			skewness has frequent small losses and a few extreme gains. A return
			distribution with negative skewness has frequent small gains and a
			few extreme losses. Zero skewness indicates a symmetric distribution
			of returns.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Kurtosis measures the peakedness of a distribution and
			provides information about the probability of extreme outcomes. A
			distribution that is more peaked than the normal distribution is
			called leptokurtic; a distribution that is less peaked than the
			normal distribution is called platykurtic; and a distribution
			identical to the normal distribution in this respect is called
			mesokurtic. The calculation for kurtosis involves finding the average
			of deviations from the mean raised to the fourth power and then
			standardizing that average by the standard deviation raised to the
			fourth power. Excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus 3, the value of
			kurtosis for all normal distributions.</li>
