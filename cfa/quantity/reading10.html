	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<ul>
		<br />
		<li>A probability distribution specifies the probabilities of the
			possible outcomes of a random variable.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The two basic types of random variables are discrete random
			variables and continuous random variables. Discrete random variables
			take on at most a countable number of possible outcomes that we can
			list as x1, x2, … In contrast, we cannot describe the possible
			outcomes of a continuous random variable Z with a list z1, z2, …
			because the outcome (z1 + z2)/2, not in the list, would always be
			possible.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The probability function specifies the probability that the
			random variable will take on a specific value. The probability
			function is denoted p(x) for a discrete random variable and f(x) for
			a continuous random variable. For any probability function p(x), 0 ≤
			p(x) ≤ 1, and the sum of p(x) over all values of X equals 1.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The cumulative distribution function, denoted F(x) for both
			continuous and discrete random variables, gives the probability that
			the random variable is less than or equal to x.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The discrete uniform and the continuous uniform distributions
			are the distributions of equally likely outcomes.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The binomial random variable is defined as the number of
			successes in n Bernoulli trials, where the probability of success, p,
			is constant for all trials and the trials are independent. A
			Bernoulli trial is an experiment with two outcomes, which can
			represent success or failure, an up move or a down move, or another
			binary (two-fold) outcome.</li>
		<br />
		<li>A binomial random variable has an expected value or mean
			equal to np and variance equal to np(1 − p).</li>
		<br />
		<li>A binomial tree is the graphical representation of a model of
			asset price dynamics in which, at each period, the asset moves up
			with probability p or down with probability (1 − p). The binomial
			tree is a flexible method for modeling asset price movement and is
			widely used in pricing options.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The normal distribution is a continuous symmetric probability
			distribution that is completely described by two parameters: its
			mean, μ, and its variance, σ<sup>2</sup>.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>A univariate distribution specifies the probabilities for a
			single random variable. A multivariate distribution specifies the
			probabilities for a group of related random variables.</li>
		<br />
		<li>To specify the normal distribution for a portfolio when its
			component securities are normally distributed, we need the means,
			standard deviations, and all the distinct pairwise correlations of
			the securities. When we have those statistics, we have also specified
			a multivariate normal distribution for the securities.</li>
		<br />
		<li>For a normal random variable, approximately 68 percent of all
			possible outcomes are within a one standard deviation interval about
			the mean, approximately 95 percent are within a two standard
			deviation interval about the mean, and approximately 99 percent are
			within a three standard deviation interval about the mean.</li>
		<br />
		<li>A normal random variable, X, is standardized using the
			expression Z = (X − μ)/σ, where μ and σ are the mean and standard
			deviation of X. Generally, we use the sample mean <SPAN
			style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">X</SPAN> as an estimate of μ and
			the sample standard deviation s as an estimate of σ in this
			expression.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>The standard normal random variable, denoted Z, has a mean
			equal to 0 and variance equal to 1. All questions about any normal
			random variable can be answered by referring to the cumulative
			distribution function of a standard normal random variable, denoted
			N(x) or N(z).</li>
		<br />
		<li>Shortfall risk is the risk that portfolio value will fall
			below some minimum acceptable level over some time horizon.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Roy’s safety-first criterion, addressing shortfall risk,
			asserts that the optimal portfolio is the one that minimizes the
			probability that portfolio return falls below a threshold level.
			According to Roy’s safety-first criterion, if returns are normally
			distributed, the safety-first optimal portfolio P is the one that
			maximizes the quantity [E(R<sub>P</sub>) − R<sub>L</sub>]/σ<sub>P</sub>,
			where R<sub>L</sub> is the minimum acceptable level of return.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>A random variable follows a lognormal distribution if the
			natural logarithm of the random variable is normally distributed. The
			lognormal distribution is defined in terms of the mean and variance
			of its associated normal distribution. The lognormal distribution is
			bounded below by 0 and skewed to the right (it has a long right
			tail).</li>
		<br />
		<li>The lognormal distribution is frequently used to model the
			probability distribution of asset prices because it is bounded below
			by zero.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Continuous compounding views time as essentially continuous
			or unbroken; discrete compounding views time as advancing in discrete
			finite intervals.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The continuously compounded return associated with a holding
			period is the natural log of 1 plus the holding period return, or
			equivalently, the natural log of ending price over beginning price.</li>
		<br />
		<li>If continuously compounded returns are normally distributed,
			asset prices are lognormally distributed. This relationship is used
			to move back and forth between the distributions for return and
			price. Because of the central limit theorem, continuously compounded
			returns need not be normally distributed for asset prices to be
			reasonably well described by a lognormal distribution.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Monte Carlo simulation involves the use of a computer to
			represent the operation of a complex financial system. A
			characteristic feature of Monte Carlo simulation is the generation of
			a large number of random samples from specified probability
			distribution(s) to represent the operation of risk in the system.
			Monte Carlo simulation is used in planning, in financial risk
			management, and in valuing complex securities. Monte Carlo simulation
			is a complement to analytical methods but provides only statistical
			estimates, not exact results.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Historical simulation is an established alternative to Monte
			Carlo simulation that in one implementation involves repeated
			sampling from a historical data series. Historical simulation is
			grounded in actual data but can reflect only risks represented in the
			sample historical data. Compared with Monte Carlo simulation,
			historical simulation does not lend itself to “what if” analyses.</li>
