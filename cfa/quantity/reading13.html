	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<ul>
		<br />
		<li>Technical analysis is a form of security analysis that uses
			price and volume market data, often graphically displayed.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Technical analysis can be used for any freely traded security
			in the global market and is used on a wide range of financial
			instruments, such as equities, bonds, commodity futures, and currency
			futures.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Technical analysis is the study of market trends or patterns
			and relies on recognition of patterns that have worked in the past in
			an attempt to predict future security prices. Technicians believe
			that market trends and patterns repeat themselves and are somewhat
			predictable because human behavior tends to repeat itself and is
			somewhat predictable.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Another tenet of technical analysis is that the market brings
			together the collective wisdom of multiple participants, weights it
			according to the size of the trades they make, and allows analysts to
			understand this collective sentiment. Technical analysis relies on
			knowledgeable market participants putting this knowledge to work in
			the market and thereby influencing prices and volume.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Technical analysis and fundamental analysis are equally
			useful and valid, but they approach the market in different ways.
			Technical analysis focuses solely on analyzing markets and the
			trading of financial instruments, whereas fundamental analysis is a
			much wider ranging field encompassing financial and economic analysis
			as well as analysis of societal and political trends.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Technical analysis relies primarily on information gathered
			from market participants that is expressed through the interaction of
			price and volume. Fundamental analysis relies on information that is
			external to the market (e.g., economic data, company financial
			information) in an attempt to evaluate a security’s value relative to
			its current price.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The usefulness of technical analysis is diminished by any
			constraints on the security being freely traded, by large outside
			manipulation of the market, and in illiquid markets.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Charts provide information about past price behavior and
			provide a basis for inferences about likely future price behavior.
			Various types of charts can be useful in studying the markets: line
			charts, bar charts, candlestick charts, and point and figure charts.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Relative strength analysis is based on the ratio of the
			prices of a security to a benchmark and is used to compare the
			performance of one asset with the performance of another asset.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Many technicians consider volume information to be very
			important and watch for the confirmation in volume of a price trend
			or the divergence of volume from a price trend.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The concept of trend is perhaps the most important aspect of
			technical analysis. An uptrend is defined as a security making higher
			highs and higher lows. To draw an uptrend line, a technician draws a
			line connecting the lows of the price chart. A downtrend is defined
			as a security making lower highs and lower lows. To draw a downtrend
			line, a technician draws a line connecting the highs of the price
			chart.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Support is defined as a low price range in which the price
			stops declining because of buying activity. It is the opposite of
			resistance, which is a price range in which price stops rising
			because of selling activity.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Chart patterns are formations appearing in price charts that
			create some type of recognizable shape.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Reversal patterns signal the end of a trend. Common reversal
			patterns are the head and shoulders, the inverse head and shoulders,
			double tops and bottoms, and triple tops and bottoms.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Continuation patterns indicate that a market trend in place
			prior to the pattern formation will continue once the pattern is
			completed. Common continuation patterns are triangles, rectangles,
			flags, and pennants.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Price-based indicators incorporate information contained in
			market prices. Common price-based indicators are the moving average
			and Bollinger Bands.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Momentum oscillator indicators are constructed from price
			data, but they are calculated so that they fluctuate either between a
			high and low, typically 0 and 100, or around 0 or 100. Some examples
			are momentum (or rate of change) oscillators, the RSI, stochastic
			measures, and MACD.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Sentiment indicators attempt to gauge investor activity for
			signs of increasing bullishness or bearishness. Sentiment indicators
			come in two forms—investor polls and calculated statistical indexes.
			Opinion polls to gauge investors’ sentiment toward the equity market
			are conducted by a variety of services. Commonly used calculated
			statistical indexes are the put/call ratio, the VIX, margin debt, and
			the short interest ratio.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Flow-of-funds indicators help technicians gauge potential
			changes in supply and demand for securities. Some commonly used
			indicators are the ARMS Index (also called the TRIN), margin debt
			(also a sentiment indicator), mutual fund cash positions, new equity
			issuance, and secondary equity offerings.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Many technicians use various observed cycles to predict
			future movements in security prices; these cycles include Kondratieff
			waves, decennial patterns, and the US presidential cycle.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Elliott Wave Theory is an approach to market forecasting that
			assumes that markets form repetitive wave patterns, which are
			themselves composed of smaller and smaller subwaves. The
			relationships among wave heights are frequently Fibonacci ratios.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Intermarket analysis is based on the principle that all
			markets are interrelated and influence each other. This approach
			involves the use of relative strength analysis for different groups
			of securities (e.g., stocks versus bonds, sectors in an economy, and
			securities from different countries) to make allocation decisions.</li>
