	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<ul>
		<br />
		<li>The net present value (NPV) of a project is the present value
			of its cash inflows minus the present value of its cash outflows. The
			internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes NPV
			equal to 0. We can interpret IRR as an expected compound return only
			when all interim cash flows can be reinvested at the internal rate of
			return and the investment is maintained to maturity.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The NPV rule for decision making is to accept all projects
			with positive NPV or, if projects are mutually exclusive, to accept
			the project with the higher positive NPV. With mutually exclusive
			projects, we rely on the NPV rule. The IRR rule is to accept all
			projects with an internal rate of return exceeding the required rate
			of return. The IRR rule can be affected by problems of scale and
			timing of cash flows.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Money-weighted rate of return and time-weighted rate of
			return are two alternative methods for calculating portfolio returns
			in a multiperiod setting when the portfolio is subject to additions
			and withdrawals. Time-weighted rate of return is the standard in the
			investment management industry. Money-weighted rate of return can be
			appropriate if the investor exercises control over additions and
			withdrawals to the portfolio.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The money-weighted rate of return is the internal rate of
			return on a portfolio, taking account of all cash flows.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The time-weighted rate of return removes the effects of
			timing and amount of withdrawals and additions to the portfolio and
			reflects the compound rate of growth of one unit of currency invested
			over a stated measurement period.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The bank discount yield for US Treasury bills (and other
			money-market instruments sold on a discount basis) is given by rBD =
			(F − P0)/F × 360/t = D/F × 360/t, where F is the face amount to be
			received at maturity, P0 is the price of the Treasury bill, t is the
			number of days to maturity, and D is the dollar discount.</li>
		<br />
		<li>For a stated holding period or horizon, holding period yield
			(HPY) = (Ending price − Beginning price + Cash
			distributions)/(Beginning price). For a US Treasury bill, HPY = D/P0.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The effective annual yield (EAY) is (1 + HPY)^365/t − 1.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The money market yield is given by rMM = HPY × 360/t, where t
			is the number of days to maturity.</li>
		<br />
		<li>For a Treasury bill, money market yield can be obtained from
			the bank discount yield using rMM = (360 × rBD)/(360 − t × rBD).</li>
		<br />
		<li>We can convert back and forth between holding period yields,
			money market yields, and effective annual yields by using the holding
			period yield, which is common to all the calculations.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The bond equivalent yield of a yield stated on a semiannual
			basis is that yield multiplied by 2.</li>

		<br />
		<li>净现值 vs 内部收益率
			<ul>
				<br />
				<li>净现值NPV = 现值-成本 = 投资项目总现金流的现值，NPV>0时可以接受项目</li>
				<br />
				<li>内部收益率 IRR，是令净现值为零的利率，IRR大于要求收益率时可以接受项目</li>
				<br />
				<li>互斥项目（mutually exclusive project），NPV和IRR结论矛盾时，用NPV结论</li>
