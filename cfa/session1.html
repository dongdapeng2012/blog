	<h3>LEARNING OUTCOMES</h3>
	<p>The candidate should be able to:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>explain ethics;</li>
		<br />
		<li>describe the role of a code of ethics in defining a
			profession;</li>
		<br />
		<li>identify challenges to ethical behavior;</li>
		<br />
		<li>describe the need for high ethical standards in the
			investment industry;</li>
		<br />
		<li>distinguish between ethical and legal standards;</li>
		<br />
		<li>describe and apply a framework for ethical decision making.</li>
		<br />
	</ol>
	--------------------
	<h3>Summary:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Ethics refers to the study of making good choices. Ethics
			encompasses a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that
			provide guidance for our behavior.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Situational influences are external factors that may shape
			our behavior</li>
		<br />
		<li>Challenges to ethical behavior include being overconfident in
			our own morality, underestimating the effect of situational
			influences, and focusing on the immediate rather than long-term
			outcomes or consequences of a decision.</li>
		<br />
		<li>In any given profession, the code of ethics publicly
			communicates the established principles and expected behavior of its
			members.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Members of a profession use specialized knowledge and skills
			to serve others; they share and agree to adhere to a common code of
			ethics to serve others and advance the profession.</li>
		<br />
		<li>A code of ethics helps foster public confidence that members
			of the profession will use their specialized skills and knowledge to
			serve their clients and others.</li>
		<br />
		<li>High ethical standards always matter and are of particular
			importance in the investment industry, which is based almost entirely
			on trust. Clients trust investment professionals to use their
			specialized skills and knowledge to serve clients and protect client
			assets. All stakeholders gain long-term benefits when investment
			professionals adhere to high ethical standards.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Rules and laws often codify ethical actions that lead to
			better outcomes for society or specific groups of stakeholders.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Organizations and individuals generally adhere to legal
			standards, but legal standards are often created to address past
			ethical failings and do not provide guidance for an evolving and
			increasingly complex world.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Legal standards are often rule based. Ethical conduct goes
			beyond legal standards, balancing self-interest with the direct and
			indirect consequences of behavior on others.</li>
		<br />
		<li>A framework for ethical decision making can help people look
			at and evaluate a decision from different perspectives, enabling them
			to identify important issues, make wise decisions, and limit
			unintended consequences.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally
			acceptable behavior required of members of a group.</li>
		<br />

	--------------------
	<h3>LEARNING OUTCOMES</h3>
	<p>The candidate should be able to:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>demonstrate the application of the Code of Ethics and
			Standards of Professional Conduct to situations involving issues of
			professional integrity;</li>
		<br />
		<li>distinguish between conduct that conforms to the Code and
			Standards and conduct that violates the Code and Standards;</li>
		<br />
		<li>recommend practices and procedures designed to prevent
			violations of the Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional
			Conduct.</li>
		<br />
	</ol>
	--------------------
	<h4 id="standardI">STANDARD I: PROFESSIONALISM</h4>
	<h4 id="standardIA">Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law</h4>
	<ul>
		<b>Members and Candidates</b>
		<li>Know and should know</li>
		<br />
		<li>工作地，居住地，产品来源地，销售地，更严格的法律</li>
		<br />
		<li>鼓励雇主制定完整程序，使得所有员工都能及时了解法律变化; 积极获取法律信息; 确保雇主能定期检查书面内控程序 ;
			公司保存文件</li>
		<br />
		<li>When in doubt about the appropriate action to undertake, it
			is recommended that a member or candidate seek the advice of
			compliance personnel or legal counsel concerning legal requirements.
			If a potential violation is being committed by a fellow employee, it
			may also be prudent for the member or candidate to seek the advice of
			the firm’s compliance department or legal counsel.</li>
		<br />
		<li>When dissociating from an activity that violates the Code and
			Standards, members and candidates should document the violation and
			urge their firms to attempt to persuade the perpetrator(s) to cease
			such conduct. To dissociate from the conduct, a member or candidate
			may have to resign his or her employment.</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<b>Firms</b>
		<li>所有相关法律法规信息公开易得; 制定应对违规的具体书面程序</li>
		<br />
		<li>Develop and/or adopt a code of ethics</li>
		<br />
	</ul>
	--------------------
	<h4 id="standardIB">Standard I(B) Independence and Objectivity</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>从业者独立客观性不应受到诱惑或威胁</li>
		<br />
		<li>Protect the integrity of opinions
			<p>Members, candidates, and their firms should establish policies
				stating that every research report concerning the securities of a
				corporate client should reflect the unbiased opinion of the analyst.
				Firms should also design compensation systems that protect the
				integrity of the investment decision process by maintaining the
				independence and objectivity of analysts.</p>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>Create a restricted list
			<p>If the firm is unwilling to permit dissemination of adverse
				opinions about a corporate client, members and candidates should
				encourage the firm to remove the controversial company from the
				research universe and put it on a restricted list so that the firm
				disseminates only factual information about the company./p>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>Restrict special cost arrangements
			<p>When attending meetings at an issuer’s headquarters, members
				and candidates should pay for commercial transportation and hotel
				charges. No corporate issuer should reimburse members or candidates
				for air transportation. Members and candidates should encourage
				issuers to limit the use of corporate aircraft to situations in
				which commercial transportation is not available or in which
				efficient movement could not otherwise be arranged. Members and
				candidates should take particular care that when frequent meetings
				are held between an individual issuer and an individual member or
				candidate, the issuer should not always host the member or
				candidate.</p>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>Limit gifts
			<p>Modest gifts and entertainment are acceptable, but special
				care must be taken by members and candidates to resist subtle and
				not-so-subtle pressures to act in conflict with the interests of
				their clients. Best practice dictates that members and candidates
				reject any offer of gift or entertainment that could be expected to
				threaten their independence and objectivity.</p>
			<p>Receiving a gift, benefit, or consideration from a client can
				be distinguished from gifts given by entities seeking to influence a
				member or candidate to the detriment of other clients. In a client
				relationship, the client has already entered some type of
				compensation arrangement with the member, candidate, or his or her
				firm. A gift from a client could be considered supplementary
				compensation. The potential for obtaining influence to the detriment
				of other clients, although present, is not as great as in situations
				where no compensation arrangement exists. When possible, prior to
				accepting “bonuses” or gifts from clients, members and candidates
				should disclose to their employers such benefits offered by clients.
				If notification is not possible prior to acceptance, members and
				candidates must disclose to their employer benefits previously
				accepted from clients. Disclosure allows the employer of a member or
				candidate to make an independent determination about the extent to
				which the gift may affect the member’s or candidate’s independence
				and objectivity.</p>
			<p>Members and candidates must limit the acceptance of gratuities
				and/or gifts to token items. Standard I(B) does not preclude
				customary, ordinary business-related entertainment as long as its
				purpose is not to influence or reward members or candidates. Firms
				should consider a strict value limit for acceptable gifts that is
				based on the local or regional customs and should address whether
				the limit is per gift or an aggregate annual value.</p>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>Restrict investments
			<p>Members and candidates should encourage their investment firms
				to develop formal policies related to employee purchases of equity
				or equity-related IPOs. Firms should require prior approval for
				employee participation in IPOs, with prompt disclosure of investment
				actions taken following the offering. Strict limits should be
				imposed on investment personnel acquiring securities in private
				placements.</p>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>Review procedures
			<p>Members and candidates should encourage their firms to
				implement effective supervisory and review procedures to ensure that
				analysts and portfolio managers comply with policies relating to
				their personal investment activities.</p>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>Independence policy
			<p>Members, candidates, and their firms should establish a formal
				written policy on the independence and objectivity of research and
				implement reporting structures and review procedures to ensure that
				research analysts do not report to and are not supervised or
				controlled by any department of the firm that could compromise the
				independence of the analyst. More detailed recommendations related
				to a firm’s policies regarding research objectivity are set forth in
				the CFA Institute statement Research Objectivity Standards
				(www.cfainstitute.org).</p>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>Appointed officer
			<p>Firms should appoint a senior officer with oversight
				responsibilities for compliance with the firm’s code of ethics and
				all regulations concerning its business. Firms should provide every
				employee with the procedures and policies for reporting potentially
				unethical behavior, violations of regulations, or other activities
				that may harm the firm’s reputation.</p>
