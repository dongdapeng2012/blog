<h4>Summary:</h4>
<p>Ethics refers to the study of making good choices. Ethics encompasses a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that provide guidance for our behavior.</p>
<p>Situational influences are external factors that may shape our behavior</p>
<p>Challenges to ethical behavior include being overconfident in our own morality, underestimating the effect of situational influences, and focusing on the immediate rather than long-term outcomes or consequences of a decision.</p>
<p>In any given profession, the code of ethics publicly communicates the established principles and expected behavior of its members.</p>
<p>Members of a profession use specialized knowledge and skills to serve others; they share and agree to adhere to a common code of ethics to serve others and advance the profession.</p>
<p>A code of ethics helps foster public confidence that members of the profession will use their specialized skills and knowledge to serve their clients and others.</p>
<p>High ethical standards always matter and are of particular importance in the investment industry, which is based almost entirely on trust. Clients trust investment professionals to use their specialized skills and knowledge to serve clients and protect client assets. All stakeholders gain long-term benefits when investment professionals adhere to high ethical standards.</p>
<p>Rules and laws often codify ethical actions that lead to better outcomes for society or specific groups of stakeholders.</p>
<p>Organizations and individuals generally adhere to legal standards, but legal standards are often created to address past ethical failings and do not provide guidance for an evolving and increasingly complex world.</p>
<p>Legal standards are often rule based. Ethical conduct goes beyond legal standards, balancing self-interest with the direct and indirect consequences of behavior on others.</p>
<p>A framework for ethical decision making can help people look at and evaluate a decision from different perspectives, enabling them to identify important issues, make wise decisions, and limit unintended consequences.</p>
