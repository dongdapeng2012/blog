	<h4>Summary:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Ethics refers to the study of making good choices. Ethics
			encompasses a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that
			provide guidance for our behavior.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Situational influences are external factors that may shape
			our behavior</li>
		<br />
		<li>Challenges to ethical behavior include being overconfident in
			our own morality, underestimating the effect of situational
			influences, and focusing on the immediate rather than long-term
			outcomes or consequences of a decision.</li>
		<br />
		<li>In any given profession, the code of ethics publicly
			communicates the established principles and expected behavior of its
			members.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Members of a profession use specialized knowledge and skills
			to serve others; they share and agree to adhere to a common code of
			ethics to serve others and advance the profession.</li>
		<br />
		<li>A code of ethics helps foster public confidence that members
			of the profession will use their specialized skills and knowledge to
			serve their clients and others.</li>
		<br />
		<li>High ethical standards always matter and are of particular
			importance in the investment industry, which is based almost entirely
			on trust. Clients trust investment professionals to use their
			specialized skills and knowledge to serve clients and protect client
			assets. All stakeholders gain long-term benefits when investment
			professionals adhere to high ethical standards.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Rules and laws often codify ethical actions that lead to
			better outcomes for society or specific groups of stakeholders.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Organizations and individuals generally adhere to legal
			standards, but legal standards are often created to address past
			ethical failings and do not provide guidance for an evolving and
			increasingly complex world.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Legal standards are often rule based. Ethical conduct goes
			beyond legal standards, balancing self-interest with the direct and
			indirect consequences of behavior on others.</li>
		<br />
		<li>A framework for ethical decision making can help people look
			at and evaluate a decision from different perspectives, enabling them
			to identify important issues, make wise decisions, and limit
			unintended consequences.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally
			acceptable behavior required of members of a group.</li>
		<br />
	</ul>

	<h3>Reading 2 Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct</h3>
	--------------------
	<h4>The candidate should be able to:</h4>
	<ol>

			Conduct Program and the process for the enforcement of the Code and
			Standards;</li>
		<br />
		<li>state the six components of the Code of Ethics and the seven
			Standards of Professional Conduct;</li>
		<br />
		<li>explain the ethical responsibilities required by the Code and
			Standards, including the sub-sections of each Standard.</li>

	</ol>

			an ethical manner with the public, clients, prospective clients,
			employers, employees, colleagues in the investment profession, and

		<li>Place the integrity of the investment profession and the
			interests of clients above their own personal interests.</li>

			judgment when conducting investment analysis, making investment
			recommendations, taking investment actions, and engaging in other
