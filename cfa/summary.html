	<h4>Summary:</h4>
	<li>Ethics refers to the study of making good choices. Ethics
		encompasses a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that
		provide guidance for our behavior.</li>
	<li>Situational influences are external factors that may shape our
		behavior</li>
	<li>Challenges to ethical behavior include being overconfident in
		our own morality, underestimating the effect of situational
		influences, and focusing on the immediate rather than long-term
		outcomes or consequences of a decision.</li>
	<li>In any given profession, the code of ethics publicly
		communicates the established principles and expected behavior of its
		members.</li>
	<li>Members of a profession use specialized knowledge and skills to
		serve others; they share and agree to adhere to a common code of
		ethics to serve others and advance the profession.</li>
	<li>A code of ethics helps foster public confidence that members of
		the profession will use their specialized skills and knowledge to
		serve their clients and others.</li>
	<li>High ethical standards always matter and are of particular
		importance in the investment industry, which is based almost entirely
		on trust. Clients trust investment professionals to use their
		specialized skills and knowledge to serve clients and protect client
		assets. All stakeholders gain long-term benefits when investment
		professionals adhere to high ethical standards.</li>
	<li>Rules and laws often codify ethical actions that lead to better
		outcomes for society or specific groups of stakeholders.</li>
	<li>Organizations and individuals generally adhere to legal
		standards, but legal standards are often created to address past
		ethical failings and do not provide guidance for an evolving and
		increasingly complex world.</li>
	<li>Legal standards are often rule based. Ethical conduct goes
		beyond legal standards, balancing self-interest with the direct and
		indirect consequences of behavior on others.</li>
	<li>A framework for ethical decision making can help people look at
		and evaluate a decision from different perspectives, enabling them to
		identify important issues, make wise decisions, and limit unintended
		consequences.</li>
